69IyAgAAQBAJ,python,"Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, revised and expanded edition",N/A,John V. Guttag,"An introductory text that teaches students the art of computational problem solving, covering topics that range from simple algorithms to information visualization. This book introduces students with little or no prior programming experience to the art of computational problem solving using Python and various Python libraries, including PyLab. It provides students with skills that will enable them to make productive use of computational techniques, including some of the tools and techniques of “data science” for using computation to model and interpret data. The book is based on an MIT course (which became the most popular course offered through MIT's OpenCourseWare) and was developed for use not only in a conventional classroom but in a massive open online course (or MOOC) offered by the pioneering MIT-Harvard collaboration edX. Students are introduced to Python and the basics of programming in the context of such computational concepts and techniques as exhaustive enumeration, bisection search, and efficient approximation algorithms. The book does not require knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but does assume that readers are comfortable with rigorous thinking and not intimidated by mathematical concepts. Although it covers such traditional topics as computational complexity and simple algorithms, the book focuses on a wide range of topics not found in most introductory texts, including information visualization, simulations to model randomness, computational techniques to understand data, and statistical techniques that inform (and misinform) as well as two related but relatively advanced topics: optimization problems and dynamic programming.

ygzJEAAAQBAJ,python,An Introduction to Statistical Learning,with Applications in Python,"Gareth James,Daniela Witten,Trevor Hastie,Robert Tibshirani,Jonathan Taylor","An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides an accessible overview of the field of statistical learning, an essential toolset for making sense of the vast and complex data sets that have emerged in fields ranging from biology to finance, marketing, and astrophysics in the past twenty years. This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, deep learning, survival analysis, multiple testing, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike, who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. Four of the authors co-wrote An Introduction to Statistical Learning, With Applications in R (ISLR), which has become a mainstay of undergraduate and graduate classrooms worldwide, as well as an important reference book for data scientists. One of the keys to its success was that each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in the R scientific computing environment. However, in recent years Python has become a popular language for data science, and there has been increasing demand for a Python-based alternative to ISLR. Hence, this book (ISLP) covers the same materials as ISLR but with labs implemented in Python.

Thiscomprehensive reference guide makes it easy to look up the mostfrequently needed information--not just about the Python languageitself, but also the most frequently used parts of the standard libraryand the most important third-party extensions. Ask any Python aficionado and you'll hear that Python programmers haveit all: an elegant object-oriented language with readable andmaintainable syntax, that allows for easy integration with componentsin C, C++, Java, or C#, and an enormous collection of precoded standardlibrary and third-party extension modules. Moreover, Python is easy tolearn, yet powerful enough to take on the most ambitious programmingchallenges. But what Python programmers used to lack is a concise andclear reference resource, with the appropriate measure of guidance inhow best to use Python's great power. Python in aNutshell fills this need.

It worked so well for me that I've used it to teach coding to grandmothers, cab drivers, musicians, and 50,000 other newbies.

That's the beauty of flash cards. But technology offers an even better way to make information stick. With my book you get almost a thousand interactive exercises--they're free online--that embed the whole book in your memory. Algorithms check your work to make sure you know what you think you know. When you stumble, you do the exercise again. You keep trying until you know the chapter cold. The exercises keep you engaged, give you extra practice where you're shaky, and prepare you for each next step. Every lesson is built on top of a solid foundation that you and I have carefully constructed. Each individual step is small.

MNF9swEACAAJ,python,Python Tutorial,Release 3.6.4,"Guido van Rossum,Python Development Team","The Python Tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well. Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, https: //www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation. The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications. For a description of standard objects and modules, see library-index. reference-index gives a more formal definition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read extending-index and c-api-index. There are also several books covering Python in depth. This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python's most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language's flavor and style.

XDszEAAAQBAJ,python,Mastering Large Datasets with Python,Parallelize and Distribute Your Python Code,John Wolohan,"Summary Modern data science solutions need to be clean, easy to read, and scalable. In Mastering Large Datasets with Python, author J.T. Wolohan teaches you how to take a small project and scale it up using a functionally influenced approach to Python coding. You’ll explore methods and built-in Python tools that lend themselves to clarity and scalability, like the high-performing parallelism method, as well as distributed technologies that allow for high data throughput. The abundant hands-on exercises in this practical tutorial will lock in these essential skills for any large-scale data science project. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. About the technology Programming techniques that work well on laptop-sized data can slow to a crawl—or fail altogether—when applied to massive files or distributed datasets. By mastering the powerful map and reduce paradigm, along with the Python-based tools that support it, you can write data-centric applications that scale efficiently without requiring codebase rewrites as your requirements change. About the book Mastering Large Datasets with Python teaches you to write code that can handle datasets of any size. You’ll start with laptop-sized datasets that teach you to parallelize data analysis by breaking large tasks into smaller ones that can run simultaneously. You’ll then scale those same programs to industrial-sized datasets on a cluster of cloud servers. With the map and reduce paradigm firmly in place, you’ll explore tools like Hadoop and PySpark to efficiently process massive distributed datasets, speed up decision-making with machine learning, and simplify your data storage with AWS S3.

oegrEAAAQBAJ,python,Explainable AI with Python,N/A,"Leonida Gianfagna,Antonio Di Cecco","This book provides a full presentation of the current concepts and available techniques to make “machine learning” systems more explainable. The approaches presented can be applied to almost all the current “machine learning” models: linear and logistic regression, deep learning neural networks, natural language processing and image recognition, among the others. Progress in Machine Learning is increasing the use of artificial agents to perform critical tasks previously handled by humans (healthcare, legal and finance, among others). While the principles that guide the design of these agents are understood, most of the current deep-learning models are ""opaque"" to human understanding. Explainable AI with Python fills the current gap in literature on this emerging topic by taking both a theoretical and a practical perspective, making the reader quickly capable of working with tools and code for Explainable AI. Beginning with examples of what Explainable AI (XAI) is and why it is needed in the field, the book details different approaches to XAI depending on specific context and need. Hands-on work on interpretable models with specific examples leveraging Python are then presented, showing how intrinsic interpretable models can be interpreted and how to produce “human understandable” explanations. Model-agnostic methods for XAI are shown to produce explanations without relying on ML models internals that are “opaque.” Using examples from Computer Vision, the authors then look at explainable models for Deep Learning and prospective methods for the future. Taking a practical perspective, the authors demonstrate how to effectively use ML and XAI in science.

vr05swEACAAJ,python,A Byte of Python,"""A Byte of Python"" Is a Free Book on Programming Using the Python Language. If All You Know about Computers Is How to Save Text Files, Then This Is the Book for You.","C. H. C H Swaroop,James Zimmerhoff","The programming language Python was conceived in the late 1980s, [1] and its implementation was started in December 1989[2] by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC (programming language) capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[3] Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL).[4][5] Python was named for the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.[6] Python 2.0 was released on October 16, 2000, with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector (in addition to reference counting) for memory management and support for Unicode. However, the most important change was to the development process itself, with a shift to a more transparent and community-backed process.[7] Python 3.0, a major, backwards-incompatible release, was released on December 3, 2008[8] after a long period of testing. Many of its major features have also been backported to the backwards-compatible Python 2.6 and 2.7.[9] In February 1991, van Rossum published the code (labeled version 0.9.0) to alt.sources.[10] Already present at this stage in development were classes with inheritance, exception handling, functions, and the core datatypes of list, dict, str and so on. Also in this initial release was a module system borrowed from Modula-3; Van Rossum describes the module as ""one of Python's major programming units.""[1] Python's exception model also resembles Modula-3's, with the addition of an else clause.[3] In 1994 comp.lang.python, the primary discussion forum for Python, was formed, marking a milestone in the growth of Python's userbase.[1] Python reached version 1.0 in January 1994. The major new features included in this release were the functional programming tools lambda, map, filter and reduce. Van Rossum stated that ""Python acquired lambda, reduce(), filter() and map(), courtesy of a Lisp hacker who missed them and submitted working patches.""[11] The last version released while Van Rossum was at CWI was Python 1.2. In 1995, Van Rossum continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston, Virginia whence he released several versions. By version 1.4, Python had acquired several new features. Notable among these are the Modula-3 inspired keyword arguments (which are also similar to Common Lisp's keyword arguments) and built-in support for complex numbers. Also included is a basic form of data hiding by name mangling, though this is easily bypassed.[12] During Van Rossum's stay at CNRI, he launched the Computer Programming for Everybody (CP4E) initiative, intending to make programming more accessible to more people, with a basic ""literacy"" in programming languages, similar to the basic English literacy and mathematics skills required by most employers. Python served a central role in this: because of its focus on clean syntax, it was already suitable, and CP4E's goals bore similarities to its predecessor, ABC. The project was funded by DARPA.[13] As of 2007, the CP4E project is inactive, and while Python attempts to be easily learnable and not too arcane in its syntax and semantics, reaching out to non-programmers is not an active concern.[14] Here are what people are saying about the book: This is the best beginner's tutorial I've ever seen!

Whether it's a data format like JSON, a network protocol like SMTP, a server configuration file for Apache, a PostScript/PDF file, or a simple spreadsheet macro language--ANTLR v4 and this book will demystify the process. ANTLR v4 has been rewritten from scratch to make it easier than ever to build parsers and the language applications built on top. This completely rewritten new edition of the bestselling Definitive ANTLR Reference shows you how to take advantage of these new features. Build your own languages with ANTLR v4, using ANTLR's new advanced parsing technology. In this book, you'll learn how ANTLR automatically builds a data structure representing the input (parse tree) and generates code that can walk the tree (visitor). You can use that combination to implement data readers, language interpreters, and translators. You'll start by learning how to identify grammar patterns in language reference manuals and then slowly start building increasingly complex grammars. Next, you'll build applications based upon those grammars by walking the automatically generated parse trees. Then you'll tackle some nasty language problems by parsing files containing more than one language (such as XML, Java, and Javadoc). You'll also see how to take absolute control over parsing by embedding Java actions into the grammar. You'll learn directly from well-known parsing expert Terence Parr, the ANTLR creator and project lead. You'll master ANTLR grammar construction and learn how to build language tools using the built-in parse tree visitor mechanism. The book teaches using real-world examples and shows you how to use ANTLR to build such things as a data file reader, a JSON to XML translator, an R parser, and a Java class->interface extractor.

Its syntax is put together from constructs borrowed from a variety of other languages; most prominent are influences from ABC, C, Modula-3 and Icon. The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C. Python is also suitable as an extension language for highly customizable C applications such as editors or window managers. Python is available for various operating systems, amongst which several flavors of UNIX, Amoeba, the Apple Macintosh O.S., and MS-DOS. This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but as the examples are self- contained, the tutorial can be read off-line as well.

You will learn how to install Python, use the Python shell to conduct basic calculations, display text on the screen and build lists, and use if statements and for loops to execute simple control flow operations (and discover what if statements and for loops are!). Here is a quick synopsis of everything each chapter has to offer. First, we provide an introduction to programming, complete with instructions on installing Python for the first time. Then Basic computations and variables are introduced in each chapter Moreover, some of the basic Python types, such as strings, lists, and tuples, are described in another chapter. Variations of conditions and if statements are covered in the book, Furthermore, for loops and while loops are taught deeply. Then we begin to use and construct functions, and we begin to use and create functions. We will also look into classes and objects in one of the chapters. We cover enough fundamental concepts to support some of the programming techniques we will need in the book's subsequent game development chapters. The content starts to get a little more complex at this stage. The majority of Python's built-in functions are covered, which continues with a few modules (essential buckets of handy functionality) that come pre-installed with Python. Everything above and more.

vqTfNFDzzdIC,python,Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture,N/A,Martin Fowler,"The practice of enterprise application development has benefited from the emergence of many new enabling technologies. Multi-tiered object-oriented platforms, such as Java and .NET, have become commonplace. These new tools and technologies are capable of building powerful applications, but they are not easily implemented. Common failures in enterprise applications often occur because their developers do not understand the architectural lessons that experienced object developers have learned. Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture is written in direct response to the stiff challenges that face enterprise application developers. The author, noted object-oriented designer Martin Fowler, noticed that despite changes in technology--from Smalltalk to CORBA to Java to .NET--the same basic design ideas can be adapted and applied to solve common problems. With the help of an expert group of contributors, Martin distills over forty recurring solutions into patterns. The result is an indispensable handbook of solutions that are applicable to any enterprise application platform. This book is actually two books in one. The first section is a short tutorial on developing enterprise applications, which you can read from start to finish to understand the scope of the book's lessons. The next section, the bulk of the book, is a detailed reference to the patterns themselves. Each pattern provides usage and implementation information, as well as detailed code examples in Java or C#.

IdNbvgAACAAJ,python,Effective Python Development for Biologists,Tools and Techniques for Building Biological Programs,Martin Jones,"Python is rapidly becoming the standard language for many talks in scientific research, and is particularly popular in biology and bioinformatics. One of the great strengths of Python is the ecosystem of tools and libraries that have grown up around it. This book introduces the novice biologist programmer to tools and techniques that make developing Python code easier and faster and will help you to write more reliable, performant programs. Written by a biologist, it focusses on solving the problems that students and researchers encounter every day: How do I make my program run faster? How can I be sure that my results are correct? How do I share this program with my colleagues? How can I speed up the process of writing my code? Chapters include: Environments for development - learn how you can take advantage of different tools for actually writing code, including those designed specifically for scientific work. Organising and sharing code - learn how Python's module and packaging system works, how to effectively reuse code across multiple projects, and how to share your programs with colleagues and the wider world. Testing - learn how automated testing can make your code more reliable, how to catch bugs before they impact your work, and how to edit code with confidence. Performance - learn how to make your code run quickly even on large datasets, how to understand the scaling behaviour of your code, and explore the trade offs involved in designing code. User interfaces - learn how to make your code more user friendly, how to design effective interfaces, and how to automate record-keeping with Python's logging system. About the author Martin started his programming career by learning Perl during the course of his PhD in evolutionary biology, and started teaching other people to program soon after. Since then he has taught introductory programming to hundreds of biologists, from undergraduates to PIs, and has maintained a philosophy that programming courses must be friendly, approachable, and practical. In his academic career, Martin mixed research and teaching at the University of Edinburgh, culminating in a two year stint as Lecturer in Bioinformatics. He now runs programming courses for biological researchers as a full time freelancer. Praise for Martin's previous books ""Great, great book. I think this is the perfect book for any biologist to who wants to start learning to code with Python... I didn't know a command-line from a hole in the ground when I first opened up this book, and mere days later I was impressing my colleagues with my own DNA analysis programs.""

vqTfNFDzzdIC,python,Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture,N/A,Martin Fowler,"The practice of enterprise application development has benefited from the emergence of many new enabling technologies. Multi-tiered object-oriented platforms, such as Java and .NET, have become commonplace. These new tools and technologies are capable of building powerful applications, but they are not easily implemented. Common failures in enterprise applications often occur because their developers do not understand the architectural lessons that experienced object developers have learned. Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture is written in direct response to the stiff challenges that face enterprise application developers. The author, noted object-oriented designer Martin Fowler, noticed that despite changes in technology--from Smalltalk to CORBA to Java to .NET--the same basic design ideas can be adapted and applied to solve common problems. With the help of an expert group of contributors, Martin distills over forty recurring solutions into patterns. The result is an indispensable handbook of solutions that are applicable to any enterprise application platform. This book is actually two books in one. The first section is a short tutorial on developing enterprise applications, which you can read from start to finish to understand the scope of the book's lessons. The next section, the bulk of the book, is a detailed reference to the patterns themselves. Each pattern provides usage and implementation information, as well as detailed code examples in Java or C#. The entire book is also richly illustrated with UML diagrams to further explain the concepts. Armed with this book, you will have the knowledge necessary to make important architectural decisions about building an enterprise application and the proven patterns for use when building them.

IdNbvgAACAAJ,python,Effective Python Development for Biologists,Tools and Techniques for Building Biological Programs,Martin Jones,"Python is rapidly becoming the standard language for many talks in scientific research, and is particularly popular in biology and bioinformatics. One of the great strengths of Python is the ecosystem of tools and libraries that have grown up around it. This book introduces the novice biologist programmer to tools and techniques that make developing Python code easier and faster and will help you to write more reliable, performant programs. Written by a biologist, it focusses on solving the problems that students and researchers encounter every day: How do I make my program run faster? How can I be sure that my results are correct? How do I share this program with my colleagues? How can I speed up the process of writing my code? Chapters include: Environments for development - learn how you can take advantage of different tools for actually writing code, including those designed specifically for scientific work. Organising and sharing code - learn how Python's module and packaging system works, how to effectively reuse code across multiple projects, and how to share your programs with colleagues and the wider world. Testing - learn how automated testing can make your code more reliable, how to catch bugs before they impact your work, and how to edit code with confidence. Performance - learn how to make your code run quickly even on large datasets, how to understand the scaling behaviour of your code, and explore the trade offs involved in designing code. User interfaces - learn how to make your code more user friendly, how to design effective interfaces, and how to automate record-keeping with Python's logging system. About the author Martin started his programming career by learning Perl during the course of his PhD in evolutionary biology, and started teaching other people to program soon after. Since then he has taught introductory programming to hundreds of biologists, from undergraduates to PIs, and has maintained a philosophy that programming courses must be friendly, approachable, and practical. In his academic career, Martin mixed research and teaching at the University of Edinburgh, culminating in a two year stint as Lecturer in Bioinformatics. He now runs programming courses for biological researchers as a full time freelancer. Praise for Martin's previous books ""Great, great book. I think this is the perfect book for any biologist to who wants to start learning to code with Python... I didn't know a command-line from a hole in the ground when I first opened up this book, and mere days later I was impressing my colleagues with my own DNA analysis programs."" ""Zero to writing useful programs in a weekend... Python for Biologists arrived last Thursday, 6/16/16, I spent the whole weekend glued to my laptop in a 2 1/2 day frenzy of coding, and I just finished it -- and came on Amazon to order the next one!""

leKCDwAAQBAJ,python,"Brave, Not Perfect","Fear Less, Fail More, and Live Bolder",Reshma Saujani,"INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER • Inspired by her popular TED Talk, the founder and CEO of Girls Who Code urges women to embrace imperfection and live a bolder, more authentic life. “A timely message for women of all ages: Perfection isn’t just impossible but, worse, insidious.”—Angela Duckworth, bestselling author of Grit Imagine if you lived without the fear of not being good enough. If you didn’t care how your life looked on Instagram. If you could let go of the guilt and stop beating yourself up for making human mistakes. Imagine if, in every decision you faced, you took the bolder path? As women, too many of us feel crushed under the weight of our own expectations. We run ourselves ragged trying to please everyone, pass up opportunities that scare us, and avoid rejection at all costs. There’s a reason we act this way, Saujani says. As girls, we were taught to play it safe. Well-meaning parents and teachers praised us for being quiet and polite, urged us to be careful so we didn’t get hurt, and steered us to activities at which we could shine. As a result, we grew up to be women who are afraid to fail. It’s time to stop letting our fears drown out our dreams and narrow our world, along with our chance at happiness. By choosing bravery over perfection, we can find the power to claim our voice, to leave behind what makes us unhappy, and to go for the things we genuinely, passionately want. Perfection may set us on a path that feels safe, but bravery leads us to the one we’re authentically meant to follow. In Brave, Not Perfect,Saujani shares powerful insights and practices to help us let go of our need for perfection and make bravery a lifelong habit. By being brave, not perfect, we can all become the authors of our best and most joyful life.",ISBN_13,False,False,210,Self-Help,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=leKCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,N/A,0.0,N/A,N/A,2019-02-05,Currency

If you’ve been curious about artificial intelligence and machine learning but didn’t know where to start, this is the book you’ve been waiting for. Focusing on the subfield of machine learning known as deep learning, it explains core concepts and gives you the foundation you need to start building your own models. Rather than simply outlining recipes for using existing toolkits, Practical Deep Learning teaches you the why of deep learning and will inspire you to explore further. All you need is basic familiarity with computer programming and high school math—the book will cover the rest. After an introduction to Python, you’ll move through key topics like how to build a good training dataset, work with the scikit-learn and Keras libraries, and evaluate your models’ performance. You’ll also learn: How to use classic machine learning models like k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines How neural networks work and how they’re trained How to use convolutional neural networks How to develop a successful deep learning model from scratch You’ll conduct experiments along the way, building to a final case study that incorporates everything you’ve learned.

-hiPzgEACAAJ,python,Python Programming for Beginners,The Ultimate Guide for Beginners to Learn Python Programming: Crash Course on Python Programming for Beginners,Amz Publishing,"The history of Python kicked off when Guido van Rossum, the founder of Python, started working on it in the late 1980s. Python is the successor of the ABC programming language. The first Python version was released back in 1991 and has only grown exponentially since then. It now has a vast community that releases the latest updates regularly. Guido van Rossum is also known as the ""Benevolent Dictator for Life"". This title was given to him by the Python community to honor him for his long-term commitment and dedication to the project and for being the project leader for such a long period. Python is a high-level interpreted programming language that is used throughout the world for general-purpose programming. It is an open-source programming language licensed by both the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and Open-Source Initiative (OSI). Like some other programming languages, its source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Python 2.x, being the legacy version, was used earlier across the globe. It stopped receiving newer features and security updates after Python 2.7, so people migrated to Python version 3.x. Throughout this book, we will be focusing more on the Python 3.x version, which is the latest and is currently in active development. Before we proceed further, I would like to inform you all that the purpose of writing this book is to make your understanding of Python clearer by explaining technical terms in layman's language with the help of code snippets and practical examples. I also wanted to make sure that the reader does not feel bored while reading the book, so I'll be adding some attractive code snippets that are appealing to the eyes.",ISBN_13,False,False,194,"N,/,A",en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-hiPzgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,N/A,0.0,N/A,N/A,2021-07-13,N/A

Step by step, you’ll learn how to install and configure Linux from the accompanying DVD, navigate its graphical user interface, provide file/printer sharing, configure network servers, secure Linux desktops and networks, work with the command line, administer Linux efficiently, and automate administration using Python and bash. Mark Sobell has taught hundreds of thousands of Linux and UNIX professionals. He knows every Linux nook and cranny–and he never forgets what it’s like to be new to Linux. Whatever you want to do with Linux–now or in the future–you’ll find it in this book.

Today John helps more than 1.4 million programmers every year to increase their income by developing this unique blend of skills. Who Should Read This Book? Entry-Level Developers - This book will show you how to ensure you have the technical skills your future boss is looking for, create a resume that leaps off a hiring manager's desk, and escape the ""no work experience"" trap. Mid-Career Developers - You'll see how to find and fill in gaps in your technical knowledge, position yourself as the one team member your boss can't live without, and turn those dreaded annual reviews into chance to make an iron-clad case for your salary bump. Senior Developers - This book will show you how to become a specialist who can command above-market wages, how building a name for yourself can make opportunities come to you, and how to decide whether consulting or entrepreneurship are paths you should pursue. Brand New Developers - In this book you'll discover what it's like to be a professional software developer, how to go from ""I know some code"" to possessing the skills to work on a development team, how to speed along your learning by avoiding common beginner traps, and how to decide whether you should invest in a programming degree or 'bootcamp.'""--",ISBN_10,False,False,796,Computer programming,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=U6GFswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,N/A,0.0,N/A,N/A,2017,"Simple Programmer, LLC"

Wws0AAAAMAAJ,python,Pretending and Meaning,Toward a Pragmatic Theory of Fictional Discourse,Richard Henry,"Since Plato, Western critics of literature have asked how it is possible for fiction writers to mean something serious. The outrage over Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses, published in 1988, highlighted our continued uneasiness over distinctions between fact and fiction, novel and history, truth and falsehood. The blasphemy charged against Rushdie raises important questions: Did Rushdie mean The Satanic Verses, or didn't he? When he publicly recanted, what did he mean? What do we even mean by mean? This is the starting point for Richard Henry's fascinating investigation of the pragmatic foundations of fictional discourse. Drawing from Paul Grice's interrogation of meaning and implicature, Henry offers a systematic correlation between what it is to pretend and what it is to mean, how the two concepts inform each other, and how it is possible to mean seriously and sincerely by purportedly pretended acts. Pretending and Meaning: Toward a Pragmatic Theory of Fictional Discourse draws upon Paul Grice's interrogation of meaning and implicature to offer a systematic correlation between what it is to pretend and what it is to mean, how the two concepts inform each other, and how it is possible to mean seriously and sincerely by purportedly pretended acts.",OTHER,False,False,152,History,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Wws0AAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,N/A,0.0,N/A,N/A,1996-06-30,Praeger

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

KvbkDwAAQBAJ,machine learning,Programming Machine Learning,From Coding to Deep Learning,Paolo Perrotta,"You've decided to tackle machine learning - because you're job hunting, embarking on a new project, or just think self-driving cars are cool. But where to start? It's easy to be intimidated, even as a software developer. The good news is that it doesn't have to be that hard. Master machine learning by writing code one line at a time, from simple learning programs all the way to a true deep learning system. Tackle the hard topics by breaking them down so they're easier to understand, and build your confidence by getting your hands dirty. Peel away the obscurities of machine learning, starting from scratch and going all the way to deep learning. Machine learning can be intimidating, with its reliance on math and algorithms that most programmers don't encounter in their regular work. Take a hands-on approach, writing the Python code yourself, without any libraries to obscure what's really going on. Iterate on your design, and add layers of complexity as you go. Build an image recognition application from scratch with supervised learning. Predict the future with linear regression. Dive into gradient descent, a fundamental algorithm that drives most of machine learning. Create perceptrons to classify data. Build neural networks to tackle more complex and sophisticated data sets. Train and refine those networks with backpropagation and batching. Layer the neural networks, eliminate overfitting, and add convolution to transform your neural network into a true deep learning system.

Today, machine learning underlies a range of applications we use every day, from product recommendations to voice recognition—as well as some we don't yet use everyday, including driverless cars. It is the basis of the new approach in computing where we do not write programs but collect data; the idea is to learn the algorithms for the tasks automatically from data. As computing devices grow more ubiquitous, a larger part of our lives and work is recorded digitally, and as “Big Data” has gotten bigger, the theory of machine learning—the foundation of efforts to process that data into knowledge—has also advanced. In this book, machine learning expert Ethem Alpaydin offers a concise overview of the subject for the general reader, describing its evolution, explaining important learning algorithms, and presenting example applications. Alpaydin offers an account of how digital technology advanced from number-crunching mainframes to mobile devices, putting today's machine learning boom in context. He describes the basics of machine learning and some applications; the use of machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition; artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain; algorithms that learn associations between instances, with such applications as customer segmentation and learning recommendations; and reinforcement learning, when an autonomous agent learns act so as to maximize reward and minimize penalty.

It contains a comprehensive guide to the system's use , the source code (about 8,800 lines), and implementation notes. C4.5 starts with large sets of cases belonging to known classes. The cases, described by any mixture of nominal and numeric properties, are scrutinized for patterns that allow the classes to be reliably discriminated. These patterns are then expressed as models, in the form of decision trees or sets of if-then rules, that can be used to classify new cases, with emphasis on making the models understandable as well as accurate. The system has been applied successfully to tasks involving tens of thousands of cases described by hundreds of properties. The book starts from simple core learning methods and shows how they can be elaborated and extended to deal with typical problems such as missing data and over hitting. Advantages and disadvantages of the C4.5 approach are discussed and illustrated with several case studies. This book should be of interest to developers of classification-based intelligent systems and to students in machine learning and expert systems courses.",ISBN_13,False,True,313,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=b3ujBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,1,5.0,US,FOR_SALE_AND_RENTAL,True,72.95,USD,58.36,USD,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b3ujBQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-b3ujBQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2014-06-28,Elsevier

A fundamental challenge when using machine learning is connecting the abstract mathematics of a machine learning technique to a concrete, real world problem. This book tackles this challenge through model-based machine learning which focuses on understanding the assumptions encoded in a machine learning system and their corresponding impact on the behaviour of the system. The key ideas of model-based machine learning are introduced through a series of case studies involving real-world applications. Case studies play a central role because it is only in the context of applications that it makes sense to discuss modelling assumptions. Each chapter introduces one case study and works through step-by-step to solve it using a model-based approach. The aim is not just to explain machine learning methods, but also showcase how to create, debug, and evolve them to solve a problem. Features: Explores the assumptions being made by machine learning systems and the effect these assumptions have when the system is applied to concrete problems. Explains machine learning concepts as they arise in real-world case studies. Shows how to diagnose, understand and address problems with machine learning systems.

dN5BDwAAQBAJ,machine learning,Machine Learners,Archaeology of a Data Practice,Adrian Mackenzie,"If machine learning transforms the nature of knowledge, does it also transform the practice of critical thought? Machine learning—programming computers to learn from data—has spread across scientific disciplines, media, entertainment, and government. Medical research, autonomous vehicles, credit transaction processing, computer gaming, recommendation systems, finance, surveillance, and robotics use machine learning. Machine learning devices (sometimes understood as scientific models, sometimes as operational algorithms) anchor the field of data science. They have also become mundane mechanisms deeply embedded in a variety of systems and gadgets. In contexts from the everyday to the esoteric, machine learning is said to transform the nature of knowledge. In this book, Adrian Mackenzie investigates whether machine learning also transforms the practice of critical thinking. Mackenzie focuses on machine learners—either humans and machines or human-machine relations—situated among settings, data, and devices. The settings range from fMRI to Facebook; the data anything from cat images to DNA sequences; the devices include neural networks, support vector machines, and decision trees. He examines specific learning algorithms—writing code and writing about code—and develops an archaeology of operations that, following Foucault, views machine learning as a form of knowledge production and a strategy of power. Exploring layers of abstraction, data infrastructures, coding practices, diagrams, mathematical formalisms, and the social organization of machine learning, Mackenzie traces the mostly invisible architecture of one of the central zones of contemporary technological cultures. Mackenzie's account of machine learning locates places in which a sense of agency can take root.

z4RyEAAAQBAJ,machine learning,"Lifelong Machine Learning, Second Edition",N/A,"Zhiyuan Chen,Bing Liu","Lifelong Machine Learning, Second Edition is an introduction to an advanced machine learning paradigm that continuously learns by accumulating past knowledge that it then uses in future learning and problem solving. In contrast, the current dominant machine learning paradigm learns in isolation: given a training dataset, it runs a machine learning algorithm on the dataset to produce a model that is then used in its intended application. It makes no attempt to retain the learned knowledge and use it in subsequent learning. Unlike this isolated system, humans learn effectively with only a few examples precisely because our learning is very knowledge-driven: the knowledge learned in the past helps us learn new things with little data or effort. Lifelong learning aims to emulate this capability, because without it, an AI system cannot be considered truly intelligent. Research in lifelong learning has developed significantly in the relatively short time since the first edition of this book was published. The purpose of this second edition is to expand the definition of lifelong learning, update the content of several chapters, and add a new chapter about continual learning in deep neural networks—which has been actively researched over the past two or three years. A few chapters have also been reorganized to make each of them more coherent for the reader. Moreover, the authors want to propose a unified framework for the research area. Currently, there are several research topics in machine learning that are closely related to lifelong learning—most notably, multi-task learning, transfer learning, and meta-learning—because they also employ the idea of knowledge sharing and transfer. This book brings all these topics under one roof and discusses their similarities and differences. Its goal is to introduce this emerging machine learning paradigm and present a comprehensive survey and review of the important research results and latest ideas in the area. This book is thus suitable for students, researchers, and practitioners who are interested in machine learning, data mining, natural language processing, or pattern recognition.

TjYXEAAAQBAJ,machine learning,Art in the Age of Machine Learning,N/A,Sofian Audry,"An examination of machine learning art and its practice in new media art and music. Over the past decade, an artistic movement has emerged that draws on machine learning as both inspiration and medium. In this book, transdisciplinary artist-researcher Sofian Audry examines artistic practices at the intersection of machine learning and new media art, providing conceptual tools and historical perspectives for new media artists, musicians, composers, writers, curators, and theorists. Audry looks at works from a broad range of practices, including new media installation, robotic art, visual art, electronic music and sound, and electronic literature, connecting machine learning art to such earlier artistic practices as cybernetics art, artificial life art, and evolutionary art. Machine learning underlies computational systems that are biologically inspired, statistically driven, agent-based networked entities that program themselves. Audry explains the fundamental design of machine learning algorithmic structures in terms accessible to the nonspecialist while framing these technologies within larger historical and conceptual spaces. Audry debunks myths about machine learning art, including the ideas that machine learning can create art without artists and that machine learning will soon bring about superhuman intelligence and creativity. Audry considers learning procedures, describing how artists hijack the training process by playing with evaluative functions; discusses trainable machines and models, explaining how different types of machine learning systems enable different kinds of artistic practices; and reviews the role of data in machine learning art, showing how artists use data as a raw material to steer learning systems and arguing that machine learning allows for novel forms of algorithmic remixes.",ISBN_13,True,True,215,Art,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TjYXEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,US,FOR_SALE,True,27.99,USD,27.99,USD,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TjYXEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-TjYXEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2021-11-23,MIT Press

MBZuEAAAQBAJ,machine learning,Dataset Shift in Machine Learning,N/A,"Joaquin Quinonero-Candela,Masashi Sugiyama,Anton Schwaighofer,Neil D. Lawrence","An overview of recent efforts in the machine learning community to deal with dataset and covariate shift, which occurs when test and training inputs and outputs have different distributions. Dataset shift is a common problem in predictive modeling that occurs when the joint distribution of inputs and outputs differs between training and test stages. Covariate shift, a particular case of dataset shift, occurs when only the input distribution changes. Dataset shift is present in most practical applications, for reasons ranging from the bias introduced by experimental design to the irreproducibility of the testing conditions at training time. (An example is -email spam filtering, which may fail to recognize spam that differs in form from the spam the automatic filter has been built on.) Despite this, and despite the attention given to the apparently similar problems of semi-supervised learning and active learning, dataset shift has received relatively little attention in the machine learning community until recently. This volume offers an overview of current efforts to deal with dataset and covariate shift. The chapters offer a mathematical and philosophical introduction to the problem, place dataset shift in relationship to transfer learning, transduction, local learning, active learning, and semi-supervised learning, provide theoretical views of dataset and covariate shift (including decision theoretic and Bayesian perspectives), and present algorithms for covariate shift.

sdbxCwAAQBAJ,machine learning,Machine Learning in Non-Stationary Environments,Introduction to Covariate Shift Adaptation,"Masashi Sugiyama,Motoaki Kawanabe","Theory, algorithms, and applications of machine learning techniques to overcome “covariate shift” non-stationarity. As the power of computing has grown over the past few decades, the field of machine learning has advanced rapidly in both theory and practice. Machine learning methods are usually based on the assumption that the data generation mechanism does not change over time. Yet real-world applications of machine learning, including image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, robot control, and bioinformatics, often violate this common assumption. Dealing with non-stationarity is one of modern machine learning's greatest challenges. This book focuses on a specific non-stationary environment known as covariate shift, in which the distributions of inputs (queries) change but the conditional distribution of outputs (answers) is unchanged, and presents machine learning theory, algorithms, and applications to overcome this variety of non-stationarity. After reviewing the state-of-the-art research in the field, the authors discuss topics that include learning under covariate shift, model selection, importance estimation, and active learning. They describe such real world applications of covariate shift adaption as brain-computer interface, speaker identification, and age prediction from facial images. With this book, they aim to encourage future research in machine learning, statistics, and engineering that strives to create truly autonomous learning machines able to learn under non-stationarity.",ISBN_13,False,True,279,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sdbxCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,N/A,0.0,N/A,N/A,2012-03-30,MIT Press

Anderson,Edward Rosenfeld","Surprising tales from the scientists who first learned how to use computers to understand the workings of the human brain. Since World War II, a group of scientists has been attempting to understand the human nervous system and to build computer systems that emulate the brain's abilities. Many of the early workers in this field of neural networks came from cybernetics; others came from neuroscience, physics, electrical engineering, mathematics, psychology, even economics. In this collection of interviews, those who helped to shape the field share their childhood memories, their influences, how they became interested in neural networks, and what they see as its future. The subjects tell stories that have been told, referred to, whispered about, and imagined throughout the history of the field. Together, the interviews form a Rashomon-like web of reality. Some of the mythic people responsible for the foundations of modern brain theory and cybernetics, such as Norbert Wiener, Warren McCulloch, and Frank Rosenblatt, appear prominently in the recollections. The interviewees agree about some things and disagree about more. Together, they tell the story of how science is actually done, including the false starts, and the Darwinian struggle for jobs, resources, and reputation. Although some of the interviews contain technical material, there is no actual mathematics in the book. Contributors James A.

JPQx7s2L1A8C,machine learning,Optimization for Machine Learning,N/A,"Suvrit Sra,Sebastian Nowozin,Stephen J. Wright","An up-to-date account of the interplay between optimization and machine learning, accessible to students and researchers in both communities. The interplay between optimization and machine learning is one of the most important developments in modern computational science. Optimization formulations and methods are proving to be vital in designing algorithms to extract essential knowledge from huge volumes of data. Machine learning, however, is not simply a consumer of optimization technology but a rapidly evolving field that is itself generating new optimization ideas. This book captures the state of the art of the interaction between optimization and machine learning in a way that is accessible to researchers in both fields. Optimization approaches have enjoyed prominence in machine learning because of their wide applicability and attractive theoretical properties. The increasing complexity, size, and variety of today's machine learning models call for the reassessment of existing assumptions. This book starts the process of reassessment. It describes the resurgence in novel contexts of established frameworks such as first-order methods, stochastic approximations, convex relaxations, interior-point methods, and proximal methods. It also devotes attention to newer themes such as regularized optimization, robust optimization, gradient and subgradient methods, splitting techniques, and second-order methods. Many of these techniques draw inspiration from other fields, including operations research, theoretical computer science, and subfields of optimization. The book will enrich the ongoing cross-fertilization between the machine learning community and these other fields, and within the broader optimization community.",ISBN_13,False,True,509,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JPQx7s2L1A8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,N/A,0.0,N/A,N/A,2012,MIT Press

C_9VEAAAQBAJ,machine learning,Machine and Deep Learning Algorithms and Applications,N/A,"Uday Shankar Shanthamallu,Andreas Spanias","This book introduces basic machine learning concepts and applications for a broad audience that includes students, faculty, and industry practitioners. We begin by describing how machine learning provides capabilities to computers and embedded systems to learn from data. A typical machine learning algorithm involves training, and generally the performance of a machine learning model improves with more training data. Deep learning is a sub-area of machine learning that involves extensive use of layers of artificial neural networks typically trained on massive amounts of data. Machine and deep learning methods are often used in contemporary data science tasks to address the growing data sets and detect, cluster, and classify data patterns. Although machine learning commercial interest has grown relatively recently, the roots of machine learning go back to decades ago. We note that nearly all organizations, including industry, government, defense, and health, are using machine learning to address a variety of needs and applications. The machine learning paradigms presented can be broadly divided into the following three categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and semi-supervised learning. Supervised learning algorithms focus on learning a mapping function, and they are trained with supervision on labeled data. Supervised learning is further sub-divided into classification and regression algorithms. Unsupervised learning typically does not have access to ground truth, and often the goal is to learn or uncover the hidden pattern in the data. Through semi-supervised learning, one can effectively utilize a large volume of unlabeled data and a limited amount of labeled data to improve machine learning model performances. Deep learning and neural networks are also covered in this book. Deep neural networks have attracted a lot of interest during the last ten years due to the availability of graphics processing units (GPU) computational power, big data, and new software platforms. They have strong capabilities in terms of learning complex mapping functions for different types of data. We organize the book as follows. The book starts by introducing concepts in supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning. Several algorithms and their inner workings are presented within these three categories. We then continue with a brief introduction to artificial neural network algorithms and their properties. In addition, we cover an array of applications and provide extensive bibliography.

Efficient Learning Machines explores the major topics of machine learning, including knowledge discovery, classifications, genetic algorithms, neural networking, kernel methods, and biologically-inspired techniques. Mariette Awad and Rahul Khanna’s synthetic approach weaves together the theoretical exposition, design principles, and practical applications of efficient machine learning. Their experiential emphasis, expressed in their close analysis of sample algorithms throughout the book, aims to equip engineers, students of engineering, and system designers to design and create new and more efficient machine learning systems. Readers of Efficient Learning Machines will learn how to recognize and analyze the problems that machine learning technology can solve for them, how to implement and deploy standard solutions to sample problems, and how to design new systems and solutions. Advances in computing performance, storage, memory, unstructured information retrieval, and cloud computing have coevolved with a new generation of machine learning paradigms and big data analytics, which the authors present in the conceptual context of their traditional precursors. Awad and Khanna explore current developments in the deep learning techniques of deep neural networks, hierarchical temporal memory, and cortical algorithms. Nature suggests sophisticated learning techniques that deploy simple rules to generate highly intelligent and organized behaviors with adaptive, evolutionary, and distributed properties. The authors examine the most popular biologically-inspired algorithms, together with a sample application to distributed datacenter management.

Jay Kuo","This book introduces the point cloud; its applications in industry, and the most frequently used datasets. It mainly focuses on three computer vision tasks -- point cloud classification, segmentation, and registration -- which are fundamental to any point cloud-based system. An overview of traditional point cloud processing methods helps readers build background knowledge quickly, while the deep learning on point clouds methods include comprehensive analysis of the breakthroughs from the past few years. Brand-new explainable machine learning methods for point cloud learning, which are lightweight and easy to train, are then thoroughly introduced. Quantitative and qualitative performance evaluations are provided. The comparison and analysis between the three types of methods are given to help readers have a deeper understanding. With the rich deep learning literature in 2D vision, a natural inclination for 3D vision researchers is to develop deep learning methods for point cloud processing. Deep learning on point clouds has gained popularity since 2017, and the number of conference papers in this area continue to increase. Unlike 2D images, point clouds do not have a specific order, which makes point cloud processing by deep learning quite challenging. In addition, due to the geometric nature of point clouds, traditional methods are still widely used in industry. Therefore, this book aims to make readers familiar with this area by providing comprehensive overview of the traditional methods and the state-of-the-art deep learning methods. A major portion of this book focuses on explainable machine learning as a different approach to deep learning. The explainable machine learning methods offer a series of advantages over traditional methods and deep learning methods. This is a main highlight and novelty of the book. By tackling three research tasks -- 3D object recognition, segmentation, and registration using our methodology -- readers will have a sense of how to solve problems in a different way and can apply the frameworks to other 3D computer vision tasks, thus give them inspiration for their own future research.

The author goes to extraordinary lengths to make academic machine learning and deep learning literature comprehensible to create a new body of knowledge. The book aims at readership from university students, enterprises, data science beginners, machine learning and deep learning engineers at scale for high-performance computing environments. A Greater Foundation of Machine Learning Engineering covers a broad range of classical linear algebra and calculus with program implementations in PyTorch, TensorFlow, R, and Python with in-depth coverage. The author does not hesitate to go into math equations for each algorithm at length that usually many foundational machine learning books lack leveraging the JupyterLab environment. Newcomers can leverage the book from University or people from all walks of data science or software lives to the advanced practitioners of machine learning and deep learning. Though the book title suggests machine learning, there are several implementations of deep learning algorithms, including deep reinforcement learning. The book's mission is to help build a strong foundation for machine learning and deep learning engineers with all the algorithms, processors to train and deploy into production for enterprise-wide machine learning implementations. This book also introduces all the concepts of natural language processing required for machine learning algorithms in Python. The book covers Bayesian statistics without assuming high-level mathematics or statistics experience from the readers. It delivers the core concepts and implementations required with R code with open datasets. The book also covers unsupervised machine learning algorithms with association rules and k-means clustering, metal-learning algorithms, bagging, boosting, random forests, and ensemble methods. The book delves into the origins of deep learning in a scholarly way covering neural networks, restricted Boltzmann machines, deep belief networks, autoencoders, deep Boltzmann machines, LSTM, and natural language processing techniques with deep learning algorithms and math equations. It leverages the NLTK library of Python with PyTorch, Python, and TensorFlow's installation steps, then demonstrates how to build neural networks with TensorFlow. Deploying machine learning algorithms require a blend of cloud computing platforms, SQL databases, and NoSQL databases. Any data scientist with a statistics background that looks to transition into a machine learning engineer role requires an in-depth understanding of machine learning project implementations on Amazon, Google, or Microsoft Azure cloud computing platforms. The book provides real-world client projects for understanding the complete implementation of machine learning algorithms. This book is a marvel that does not leave any application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms. It sets a more excellent foundation for newcomers and expands the horizons for experienced deep learning practitioners. It is almost inevitable that there will be a series of more advanced algorithms follow-up books from the author in some shape or form after setting such a perfect foundation for machine learning engineering.",ISBN_13,True,False,382,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_gRHEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,US,FOR_SALE,True,39.99,USD,31.19,USD,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_gRHEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book-_gRHEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2021-10-01,Xlibris Corporation

qNNmDwAAQBAJ,machine learning,Principles,N/A,Ray Dalio,"#1 New York Times Bestseller “Significant...The book is both instructive and surprisingly moving.” —The New York Times Ray Dalio, one of the world’s most successful investors and entrepreneurs, shares the unconventional principles that he’s developed, refined, and used over the past forty years to create unique results in both life and business—and which any person or organization can adopt to help achieve their goals. In 1975, Ray Dalio founded an investment firm, Bridgewater Associates, out of his two-bedroom apartment in New York City. Forty years later, Bridgewater has made more money for its clients than any other hedge fund in history and grown into the fifth most important private company in the United States, according to Fortune magazine. Dalio himself has been named to Time magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Along the way, Dalio discovered a set of unique principles that have led to Bridgewater’s exceptionally effective culture, which he describes as “an idea meritocracy that strives to achieve meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical transparency.” It is these principles, and not anything special about Dalio—who grew up an ordinary kid in a middle-class Long Island neighborhood—that he believes are the reason behind his success. In Principles, Dalio shares what he’s learned over the course of his remarkable career. He argues that life, management, economics, and investing can all be systemized into rules and understood like machines. The book’s hundreds of practical lessons, which are built around his cornerstones of “radical truth” and “radical transparency,” include Dalio laying out the most effective ways for individuals and organizations to make decisions, approach challenges, and build strong teams. He also describes the innovative tools the firm uses to bring an idea meritocracy to life, such as creating “baseball cards” for all employees that distill their strengths and weaknesses, and employing computerized decision-making systems to make believability-weighted decisions. While the book brims with novel ideas for organizations and institutions, Principles also offers a clear, straightforward approach to decision-making that Dalio believes anyone can apply, no matter what they’re seeking to achieve.

Whether it's a data format like JSON, a network protocol like SMTP, a server configuration file for Apache, a PostScript/PDF file, or a simple spreadsheet macro language--ANTLR v4 and this book will demystify the process. ANTLR v4 has been rewritten from scratch to make it easier than ever to build parsers and the language applications built on top. This completely rewritten new edition of the bestselling Definitive ANTLR Reference shows you how to take advantage of these new features. Build your own languages with ANTLR v4, using ANTLR's new advanced parsing technology. In this book, you'll learn how ANTLR automatically builds a data structure representing the input (parse tree) and generates code that can walk the tree (visitor). You can use that combination to implement data readers, language interpreters, and translators. You'll start by learning how to identify grammar patterns in language reference manuals and then slowly start building increasingly complex grammars. Next, you'll build applications based upon those grammars by walking the automatically generated parse trees. Then you'll tackle some nasty language problems by parsing files containing more than one language (such as XML, Java, and Javadoc). You'll also see how to take absolute control over parsing by embedding Java actions into the grammar. You'll learn directly from well-known parsing expert Terence Parr, the ANTLR creator and project lead. You'll master ANTLR grammar construction and learn how to build language tools using the built-in parse tree visitor mechanism. The book teaches using real-world examples and shows you how to use ANTLR to build such things as a data file reader, a JSON to XML translator, an R parser, and a Java class->interface extractor.

Unfortunately, acquiring and incorporating the necessary domain knowledge can be a significant problem when building a practical planning system. The knowledge engineering process is typically time-consuming and expensive. Furthermore, if a human expert is not available it may be extremely difficult to obtain the necessary knowledge. One solution is for a system to automatically acquire domain-specific knowledge through learning. The idea of a planning system that can improve its performance with experience is very attractive. Furthermore, advances in machine learning have provided a deeper understanding of learning mechanisms relevant to acquiring such knowledge. For this reason, there is a great deal of interest in this area of artificial intelligence.

The interplay between optimization and machine learning is one of the most important developments in modern computational science. Optimization formulations and methods are proving to be vital in designing algorithms to extract essential knowledge from huge volumes of data. Machine learning, however, is not simply a consumer of optimization technology but a rapidly evolving field that is itself generating new optimization ideas. This book captures the state of the art of the interaction between optimization and machine learning in a way that is accessible to researchers in both fields. Optimization approaches have enjoyed prominence in machine learning because of their wide applicability and attractive theoretical properties. The increasing complexity, size, and variety of today's machine learning models call for the reassessment of existing assumptions. This book starts the process of reassessment. It describes the resurgence in novel contexts of established frameworks such as first-order methods, stochastic approximations, convex relaxations, interior-point methods, and proximal methods. It also devotes attention to newer themes such as regularized optimization, robust optimization, gradient and subgradient methods, splitting techniques, and second-order methods. Many of these techniques draw inspiration from other fields, including operations research, theoretical computer science, and subfields of optimization.

In the first part, an overview on complex networks and network-based machine learning is presented, offering necessary background material. In the second part, we describe in details some specific techniques based on complex networks for supervised, non-supervised, and semi-supervised learning. Particularly, a stochastic particle competition technique for both non-supervised and semi-supervised learning using a stochastic nonlinear dynamical system is described in details. Moreover, an analytical analysis is supplied, which enables one to predict the behavior of the proposed technique. In addition, data reliability issues are explored in semi-supervised learning. Such matter has practical importance and is not often found in the literature. With the goal of validating these techniques for solving real problems, simulations on broadly accepted databases are conducted. Still in this book, we present a hybrid supervised classification technique that combines both low and high orders of learning. The low level term can be implemented by any classification technique, while the high level term is realized by the extraction of features of the underlying network constructed from the input data. Thus, the former classifies the test instances by their physical features, while the latter measures the compliance of the test instances with the pattern formation of the data. We show that the high level technique can realize classification according to the semantic meaning of the data.

With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book’s coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression & path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering.

_wgiywEACAAJ,machine learning,Adversarial Machine Learning,N/A,"Yevgeniy Vorobeychik,Murat Kantarcioglu","The increasing abundance of large high-quality datasets, combined with significant technical advances over the last several decades have made machine learning into a major tool employed across a broad array of tasks including vision, language, finance, and security. However, success has been accompanied with important new challenges: many applications of machine learning are adversarial in nature. Some are adversarial because they are safety critical, such as autonomous driving. An adversary in these applications can be a malicious party aimed at causing congestion or accidents, or may even model unusual situations that expose vulnerabilities in the prediction engine. Other applications are adversarial because their task and/or the data they use are. For example, an important class of problems in security involves detection, such as malware, spam, and intrusion detection. The use of machine learning for detecting malicious entities creates an incentive among adversaries to evade detection by changing their behavior or the content of malicius objects they develop. The field of adversarial machine learning has emerged to study vulnerabilities of machine learning approaches in adversarial settings and to develop techniques to make learning robust to adversarial manipulation. This book provides a technical overview of this field. After reviewing machine learning concepts and approaches, as well as common use cases of these in adversarial settings, we present a general categorization of attacks on machine learning. We then address two major categories of attacks and associated defenses: decision-time attacks, in which an adversary changes the nature of instances seen by a learned model at the time of prediction in order to cause errors, and poisoning or training time attacks, in which the actual training dataset is maliciously modified. In our final chapter devoted to technical content, we discuss recent techniques for attacks on deep learning, as well as approaches for improving robustness of deep neural networks. We conclude with a discussion of several important issues in the area of adversarial learning that in our view warrant further research. Given the increasing interest in the area of adversarial machine learning, we hope this book provides readers with the tools necessary to successfully engage in research and practice of machine learning in adversarial settings.",ISBN_10,False,False,152,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_wgiywEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,N/A,0.0,N/A,N/A,2018-08-08,Springer

25nyswEACAAJ,machine learning,Machine Learning With Matlab,Supervised Learning and Classification,J. Smith,"Machine learning teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn from experience. Machine learning algorithms use computational methods to ""learn"" information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model. The algorithms adaptively improve their performance as the number of samples available for learning increases. Machine learning uses two types of techniques: supervised learning, which trains a model on known input and output data so that it can predict future outputs, and unsupervised learning, which finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in input data. The aim of supervised machine learning is to build a model that makes predictions based on evidence in the presence of uncertainty. A supervised learning algorithm takes a known set of input data and known responses to the data (output) and trains a model to generate reasonable predictions for the response to new data. Supervised learning uses classification and regression techniques to develop predictive models. -Classification techniques predict categorical responses, for example, whether an email is genuine or spam, or whether a tumor is cancerous or benign. Classification models classify input data into categories. Typical techniques include Support Vector Machine, Discriminant Analysis, Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbor, Classification Trees and Neural Networks. -Regression techniques predict continuous responses, for example, changes in temperature or fluctuations in power demand. Typical applications include electricity load forecasting and algorithmic trading.

B6Z1EAAAQBAJ,machine learning,The Self-Assembling Brain,How Neural Networks Grow Smarter,Peter Robin Hiesinger,"""In this book, Peter Robin Hiesinger explores historical and contemporary attempts to understand the information needed to make biological and artificial neural networks. Developmental neurobiologists and computer scientists with an interest in artificial intelligence - driven by the promise and resources of biomedical research on the one hand, and by the promise and advances of computer technology on the other - are trying to understand the fundamental principles that guide the generation of an intelligent system. Yet, though researchers in these disciplines share a common interest, their perspectives and approaches are often quite different. The book makes the case that ""the information problem"" underlies both fields, driving the questions that are driving forward the frontiers, and aims to encourage cross-disciplinary communication and understanding, to help both fields make progress. The questions that challenge researchers in these fields include the following. How does genetic information unfold during the years-long process of human brain development, and can this be a short-cut to create human-level artificial intelligence? Is the biological brain just messy hardware that can be improved upon by running learning algorithms in computers? Can artificial intelligence bypass evolutionary programming of ""grown"" networks? These questions are tightly linked, and answering them requires an understanding of how information unfolds algorithmically to generate functional neural networks. Via a series of closely linked ""discussions"" (fictional dialogues between researchers in different disciplines) and pedagogical ""seminars,"" the author explores the different challenges facing researchers working on neural networks, their different perspectives and approaches, as well as the common ground and understanding to be found amongst those sharing an interest in the development of biological brains and artificial intelligent systems""--",ISBN_13,False,True,384,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=B6Z1EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,US,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,N/A,0.0,N/A,N/A,2022-12-13,Princeton University Press

-MGZEAAAQBAJ,machine learning,"Artificial Intelligence, Design Law and Fashion",N/A,Hasan Kadir Yılmaztekin,"Artificial intelligence (AI) now infiltrates our culture. After a couple of difficult winters, AI today is a word on everybody’s lips, and it attracts everyone’s attention regardless of whether they are experts or not. From Apple’s Siri to Amazon’s Alexa, Tesla’s auto-driving cars to facial recognition systems in CCTV cameras, Netflix’s film offering services to Google’s search engine, we live in a world of AI goods. The advent of AI-powered technologies increasingly affects people’s lives across the globe. As a tool for productivity and cost-efficiency, AI also shapes our economy and welfare. AI-generated designs and works are becoming more popular. Today, AI technologies can generate several intellectual creations. Fashion is one of the industries that AI can profoundly impact. AI tools and devices are currently being used in the fashion industry to create fashion models, fabric and jewellery designs, and clothing. When we talk about AI-generated designs, we instead focus on the fruits of innovation – more best-selling apparels, more fashionable designs and more fulfilment of customer expectations – without paying heed to who the designer is. Designers invest a lot of talent, time and finances into designing and creating each article of clothing and accessory before they release their work to the public. Pattern drafting is the first and most important step in dressmaking. Designers typically start with a general sketch on paper; add styles, elements and colours; revise and refine everything; and finally deliver their design to dressmakers. AI accelerates this time-consuming and labour-intensive process. Yet the full legal consequences of AI in fashion industry are often forgotten. An AI device’s ability to generate fashion designs raises the question of who will own intellectual property rights over the fashion designs. Will it be the fashion designer who hires or contracts with the AI programmer? Will it be the programmer? Will it be the AI itself? Or will it be a joint work of humans and computers? And who will be liable for infringement deriving from use of third-party material in AI-generated fashion designs? This book explores answers to these questions within the framework of EU design and copyright laws. It also crafts a solution proposal based on a three-step test and model norms, which could be used to unleash the authors, rights holders and infringers around AI-generated fashion designs.",ISBN_13,True,True,203,Law,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-MGZEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,US,FOR_SALE,True,51.99,USD,41.07,USD,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-MGZEAAAQBAJ&rdid=book--MGZEAAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api,2022-12-30,Taylor & Francis

u9EHEAAAQBAJ,machine learning,GIS and Machine Learning for Small Area Classifications in Developing Countries,N/A,Adegbola Ojo,"Since the emergence of contemporary area classifications, population geography has witnessed a renaissance in the area of policy related spatial analysis. Area classifications subsume geodemographic systems which often use data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms to simplify large and complex bodies of information about people and the places in which they live, work and undertake other social activities. Outputs developed from the grouping of small geographical areas on the basis of multi- dimensional data have proved beneficial particularly for decision-making in the commercial sectors of a vast number of countries in the northern hemisphere. This book argues that small area classifications offer countries in the Global South a distinct opportunity to address human population policy related challenges in novel ways using area-based initiatives and evidence-based methods. This book exposes researchers, practitioners, and students to small area segmentation techniques for understanding, interpreting, and visualizing the configuration, dynamics, and correlates of development policy challenges at small spatial scales. It presents strategic and operational responses to these challenges in cost effective ways.

XcAMEQAAQBAJ,machine learning,Fog Computing for Intelligent Cloud IoT Systems,N/A,"Chandan Banerjee,Anupam Ghosh,Rajdeep Chakraborty,Ahmed A. Elngar","FOG COMPUTING FOR INTELLIGENT CLOUD IOT SYSTEMS This book is a comprehensive guide on fog computing and how it facilitates computing, storage, and networking services Fog computing is a decentralized computing structure that connects data, devices, and the cloud. It is an extension of cloud computing and is an essential concept in IoT (Internet of Things), as it reduces the burden of processing in cloud computing. It brings intelligence and processing closer to where the data is created and transmitted to other sources. Fog computing has many benefits, such as reduced latency in processing data, better response time that helps the user’s experience, and security and privacy compliance that assures protecting the vital data in the cloud. It also reduces the cost of bandwidth, because the processing is achieved in the cloud, which reduces network bandwidth usage and increases efficiency as user devices share data in the local processing infrastructure rather than the cloud service. Fog computing has various applications across industries, such as agriculture and farming, the healthcare industry, smart cities, education, and entertainment. For example, in the agriculture industry, a very prominent example is the SWAMP project, which stands for Smart Water Management Platform. With fog computing’s help, SWAMP develops a precision-based smart irrigation system concept used in agriculture, minimizing water wastage. This book is divided into three sections. The first section studies fog computing and machine learning, covering fog computing architecture, application perspective, computational offloading in mobile cloud computing, intelligent Cloud-IoT systems, machine learning fundamentals, and data visualization. The second section focuses on applications and analytics, spanning various applications of fog computing, such as in healthcare, Industry 4.0, cancer cell detection systems, smart farming, and precision farming. This section also covers analytics in fog computing using big data and patient monitoring systems, and the emergence of fog computing concerning applications and potentialities in traditional and digital educational systems. Security aspects in fog computing through blockchain and IoT, and fine-grained access through attribute-based encryption for fog computing are also covered.

IxaIEAAAQBAJ,machine learning,Soil and Crop Sensing for Precision Crop Production,N/A,"Minzan Li,Chenghai Yang,Qin Zhang","Soil and crop sensing is a fundamental component and the first important step in precision agriculture. Unless the level of soil and crop variability is known, appropriate management decisions cannot be made and implemented. In the last few decades, various ground-based sensors have been developed to measure spatial variability in soil properties and nutrients, crop growth and yield, and pest conditions. Remote sensing as an important data collection tool has been increasingly used to map soil and crop growth variability as spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions of image data have improved significantly in recent years. While identifying spatial variability of soil and crop growth within fields is an important first step towards precision management, using that variability to formulate variable rate application plans of farming inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides is another essential step in precision agriculture.The purpose of this book is to present the historical, current and future developments of soil and crop sensing technologies with fundamentals and practical examples. The first chapter gives an overview of soil and crop sensing technologies for precision crop production. The next six chapters provide details on theories, methods, practical applications, as well as challenges and future research needs for all aspects of soil and crop sensing. The last two chapters show how soil and crop sensing technologies can be used for plant phenotyping and precision fertilization. The chapters are written by some of the world’s leading experts who have contributed significantly to the developments of precision agriculture technologies, especially in the area of soil and crop sensing.
